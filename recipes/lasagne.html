    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagne is a classic Italian dish characterized by its layered construction. It typically consists of wide, flat pasta sheets (called lasagne noodles) that are alternated with layers of rich and flavorful fillings.</p>
    <p>The most common fillings include a meat-based ragù (slow-cooked meat sauce), a creamy béchamel sauce, and cheese, most notably ricotta and mozzarella. Parmesan cheese is often sprinkled on top for added flavor and a golden-brown crust.</p>
